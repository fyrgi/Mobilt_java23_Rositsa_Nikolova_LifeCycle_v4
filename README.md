As part of the education i n java development in the course Mobile app development, the requirements are to have at least 2 activities with a login function with hard coded data.
After successful login the user will be able to see a form with several different elements. 

The app should allow the user to see the data already in the account via SharedPReferences. 

A custum icon is added. The Android studio library is used for the clip art so the default one is changed to another one.
